# Variant Annotation - Python
This scripts reads an output file generated by SnpEff, normalizes and corrects most of the consistent errors of SnpEff.
The input file that is read by the script consists of two columns. 
The first column is the variant id. Its type is an integer.
The second column is the "ANN" column output generated by SnpEff. 
The bash command used to generate that file is the following:

```
snpEff ann -config snpEff.config -upDownStreamLen 2000 -spliceSiteSize 0 -spliceRegionExonSize 0 -spliceRegionIntronMax 0 -spliceRegionIntronMin 0 NC_000962.3 tmp.vcf | grep -v "^#" | cut -f3,8 > annotated_file.txt

```
